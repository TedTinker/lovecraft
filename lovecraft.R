# What I'd like to do:

# make a table that has each sentence of alchemist.txt in another row
# count the number of words in each sentence
# make graph of intenisty like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaXdkb-hx6A
# Do the same for every story. How do stories compare?

# Then, make a frequency chart showing which words appear in which stories.
